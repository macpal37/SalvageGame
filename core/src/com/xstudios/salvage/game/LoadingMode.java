 * much later in the course. This class provides a basic template for a loading screen to be used at
 * the start of the game or between levels. Feel free to adopt this to your needs.
 *
 * <p>You will note that this mode has some textures that are not loaded by the AssetManager. You
 * are never required to load through the AssetManager. But doing this will block the application.
 * That is why we try to have as few resources as possible for this loading screen.
