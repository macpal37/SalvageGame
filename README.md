# SalvageGame

The goal of the game is to navigate the maze and find the body (represented by Professor White's head), then bring it back to the start position. There is a limited amount of oxygen that decreases over time; the rate accelerates when the player moves and also when carrying the body. Players use the arrow keys to move up, down, left and right. There are a series of controls that can configure various game parameters such as field of vision, player speed, and rate of oxygen depletion.
